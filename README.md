# Correlation-Analysis
Correlation Analysis performed on Movies dataset from kaggle, part of "Alex the Analyst" youtube tutorial series.

Below are the list of tasks I have performed :
- Used Google Colab to look at various ways to upload data as dataframe (Pandas)
- Cleaned and formatted data as per requirements
- Visualize the data using matplot & seaborn
- Created correlation matrix to identify features that effect the money made by movies
